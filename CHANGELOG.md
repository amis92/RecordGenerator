## [Unreleased]

### Changed

* Parameters of generated record methods use camel-casing, as opposed to
  Pascal-casing previously, to align with naming conventions in .NET.
* The name of the parameter to `With*` methods now always reads `value`
  as opposed to being named after the property verbatim.
* `RecordAttribute` is now in `Amadevus.RecordGenerator` namespace (previously in global/no namespace)

### Added

* [`Object.ToString`][objtostr] override for records that follows the same
  implementation as C# generates for anonymous types
* `GeneratedCodeAttribute` is added to generated non-type members (methods, properties)
* `Features` flags enum in Attributes package for requesting specific feature set generation
* `DefaultRecordFeaturesAttribute`  in Attributes package for setting assembly-default feature set
* `RecordAttribute(Features)` constructor for customizing feature set generation per class
