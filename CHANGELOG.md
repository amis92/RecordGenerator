All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

* Parameters of generated record methods use camel-casing, as opposed to
  Pascal-casing previously, to align with naming conventions in .NET.
* The name of the parameter to `With*` methods now always reads `value`
  as opposed to being named after the property verbatim.
* `RecordAttribute` is now in `Amadevus.RecordGenerator` namespace (previously in global/no namespace)
* Analyzer for requiring Records to be partial, and a CodeFix to do so now works on structs
* Equality operations are generated by default

### Added

* `struct` definitions now supported
* [`Object.ToString`][objtostr] override for records that follows the same
  implementation as C# generates for anonymous types
* `GeneratedCodeAttribute` is added to generated non-type members (methods, properties)
* `Features` flags enum in Attributes package for requesting specific feature set generation
* `RecordAttribute(Features)` constructor for customizing feature set generation per class
* Equality feature as a default, also behind `Features.Equality` flag.
	* [`object.Equals(object)`][objectEquals], [`object.GetHashCode()`][objectGetHashCode] overrides
	* [`IEquatable<TRecord>`][iEquatable], [`operator ==/!=`][equalityOperators] implementations
* Analyzer warning on Equality-enabled Record classes that are not sealed,
  providing CodeFix that adds `sealed` modifier.
* Analyzer erroring on Record entry names that differ only by case
  (this could cause collisions when changing name casings, e.g. for constructor
  parameter names)
