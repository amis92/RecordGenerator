## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2020-04-08
### Changed

* Update dependency: `CodeGeneration.Roslyn` v0.7.63; this drops the requirement for
  `dotnet-codegen` `DotNetCliToolReference` - now you only need `PackageReference` to
  `Amadevus.RecordGenerator` ([#127])!

[#127]: https://github.com/amis92/RecordGenerator/pull/127

## [0.5.0] - 2020-03-30
### Changed

* Parameters of generated record methods use camel-casing, as opposed to
  Pascal-casing previously, to align with naming conventions in .NET.
* The name of the parameter to `With*` methods now always reads `value`
  as opposed to being named after the property verbatim.
* `RecordAttribute` is now in `Amadevus.RecordGenerator` namespace (previously in global/no namespace)
* Analyzer for requiring Records to be partial, and a CodeFix to do so now works on structs
* ~~Equality operations are generated by default~~ **reverted for preview.3**.

### Added

* `struct` definitions now supported
* [`Object.ToString`][objtostr] override for records that follows the same
  implementation as C# generates for anonymous types
* `GeneratedCodeAttribute` is added to generated non-type members (methods, properties)
* `Features` flags enum in Attributes package for requesting specific feature set generation
* `RecordAttribute(Features)` constructor for customizing feature set generation per class
* Equality feature behind `Features.Equality` flag.
  * [`object.Equals(object)`][objectEquals], [`object.GetHashCode()`][objectGetHashCode] overrides
  * [`IEquatable<TRecord>`][iEquatable], [`operator ==/!=`][equalityOperators] implementations
* Analyzer warning on Equality-enabled Record classes that are not sealed,
  providing CodeFix that adds `sealed` modifier.
* Analyzer erroring on Record entry names that differ only by case
  (this could cause collisions when changing name casings, e.g. for constructor
  parameter names)

## [0.4.1] - 2019-03-22
### Changed
* Fixed handling of get-only expression body properties (e.g. `int Count { get => 0; }`) [#52].

[#52]: https://github.com/amis92/RecordGenerator/issues/52

## [0.4.0] - 2018-12-05
### Changed
* `Amadeuvs.RecordGenerator` package: Remove DevelopmentDependency flag, drop target framework. Essentially an aggregate of dependency packages for simple installation.
* Updated reference of CodeGeneration.Roslyn to v0.4.88.
* Skipping generation for 0-entries records [#27].
* Fixed: Deconstructor not compiling when parameter name would be a keyword [#32].
* `Validate` called before field assignments and pass values by ref [#50].

[#50]: https://github.com/amis92/RecordGenerator/issues/50

## [0.3.4] - 2018-05-19
###Changed
* Fixed a bug with generic property types [#32].

[#32]: https://github.com/amis92/RecordGenerator/issues/32

## [0.3.3] - 2018-05-18
### Changed
* Updated reference of CodeGeneration.Roslyn to v0.4.49.

## [0.3.2] - 2018-05-14
### Changed
* Fixed the meta-package to actually depend on correct CodeGeneration.Roslyn version (0.4.42).

## [0.3.1] - 2018-05-14
### Changed
* Updated reference of CodeGeneration.Roslyn to v0.4.42.
* Targeting `netstandard1.6` (was 1.5).

## [0.3.0] - 2018-01-18
### Changed
* Moved generation to build-time using AArnott's CodeGeneration.Roslyn package, requires more installation steps but creates backing code automatically during build which is definitely an improvement. Also decomposed project into Generators, Analyzers and Attributes subpackages.

## [0.2.1] - 2017-10-22
### Changed
* Bugfix. Doesn't raise false RG0003 'requires regeneration' errors for Records nested in Records. Also now diff is attached to that error message.

## [0.2.0] - 2017-09-19
### Changed
* Bugfixes. Now ignores static properties and doesn't include interfaces/base classes in partial declaration.

## [0.1.1] - 2017-04-14
### Changed
* Fixed layout to match analyzer requirements.

## [0.1.0] - 2017-04-12
### Added
* Initial release with support for constructor and With-mutators.
