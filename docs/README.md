## Description
[Description]: #description

C# Record Generator makes creating record classes a breeze! Just adorn your data class with `[Record]` attribute and keep your code clean and simple. The backing code is generated on build-time, including IntelliSense support (just save the file, Visual Studio will make a build in background).

## Installation
[Installation]: #installation

As it is a NuGet, it's really simple:

* Package Manager `Install-Package Amadevus.RecordGenerator`
* Or from `Manage NuGet packages` search for `Amadevus.RecordGenerator`

Also see [Requirements] for `NuGet.config` setup.

## Usage
[Usage]: #usage

```cs
namespace TestApp
{
    [Record]
    partial class RecordTest
    {
        public string Name { get; }
    }
}
```

As you can see, it's very nice and easy. You just have to **decorate your class
with `[Record]` attribute** and voilà, you have made yoursef a record type!

##### What does it mean, a record type?

A record type is an immutable named container for a bunch of objects (properties). As it is,
C# doesn't provide an easy way to create immutable types - that's where RecordGenerator comes to
the rescue!

##### What do I get?

The generator creates new partial for your type with additional members. The generator first
acquires a list of record entries - properties that are read-only and auto-implemented
(which basically means they're `public SomeType SomeName { get; }`). Then it generates additional
members which make using your record actually possible. These are currently (v0.3.0):

1. Constructor that has a parameter for every record entry, and assigns those parameters
   to corresponding auto-properties.
2. `With` mutators which take single record entry parameter and return new record instance
   with all values of record entries taken from current instance, except the parameter one which 
   is changed.
3. `Update` method which essentially wraps constructor.
4. `Builder` nested class which has read-write properties same as record type and a `ToImmutable`
    method which returns a new record instance with builder's properties copied.
5. `ToBuilder` method which creates a builder with record's properties copied.
6. `Deconstruct` method which enables deconstruction of record into a list of variables like
    tuples do since C# 7.0 (ValueTuple).
7. `Validate` partial method called from constructor after all properties are assigned. You may
    (but don't have to) implement it - this would be the place to check for null arguments or similar.

## Examples
[Examples]: #examples

### Person
[Person]: #person

Simple person record with different properties (builtin types like string, System type DateTime,
type parameter TDetails).

Given:

> `Person.cs`

```cs
using System;

namespace ClassLibrary1
{
    [Record]
    public partial class Person<TDetails>
    {
        public string FirstName { get; }

        public string LastName { get; }

        public string Address { get; }

        public DateTime Birthday { get; }

        public TDetails Details { get; }
    }
}
```

Generates (in /obj (intermediate directory)):

> ``Person`1.xWokCDnE.generated.cs``

```cs
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// <auto-generated>
//     This code was generated by a tool.
//
//     Changes to this file may cause incorrect behavior and will be lost if
//     the code is regenerated.
// </auto-generated>
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

using System;

partial class Person<TDetails>
{
    public Person(string FirstName, string LastName, string Address, DateTime Birthday, TDetails Details)
    {
        this.FirstName = FirstName;
        this.LastName = LastName;
        this.Address = Address;
        this.Birthday = Birthday;
        this.Details = Details;
        Validate();
    }

    public Person<TDetails> Update(string FirstName, string LastName, string Address, DateTime Birthday, TDetails Details)
    {
        return new Person<TDetails>(FirstName, LastName, Address, Birthday, Details);
    }

    public Person<TDetails> WithFirstName(string FirstName)
    {
        return Update(FirstName, LastName, Address, Birthday, Details);
    }

    public Person<TDetails> WithLastName(string LastName)
    {
        return Update(FirstName, LastName, Address, Birthday, Details);
    }

    public Person<TDetails> WithAddress(string Address)
    {
        return Update(FirstName, LastName, Address, Birthday, Details);
    }

    public Person<TDetails> WithBirthday(DateTime Birthday)
    {
        return Update(FirstName, LastName, Address, Birthday, Details);
    }

    public Person<TDetails> WithDetails(TDetails Details)
    {
        return Update(FirstName, LastName, Address, Birthday, Details);
    }

    partial void Validate();
}

partial class Person<TDetails>
{
    public Builder ToBuilder()
    {
        return new Builder{FirstName = FirstName, LastName = LastName, Address = Address, Birthday = Birthday, Details = Details};
    }

    public partial class Builder
    {
        public string FirstName
        {
            get;
            set;
        }

        public string LastName
        {
            get;
            set;
        }

        public string Address
        {
            get;
            set;
        }

        public DateTime Birthday
        {
            get;
            set;
        }

        public TDetails Details
        {
            get;
            set;
        }

        public Person<TDetails> ToImmutable()
        {
            return new Person<TDetails>(FirstName, LastName, Address, Birthday, Details);
        }
    }
}

partial class Person<TDetails>
{
    public void Deconstruct(out string firstName, out string lastName, out string address, out DateTime birthday, out TDetails details)
    {
        firstName = this.FirstName;
        lastName = this.LastName;
        address = this.Address;
        birthday = this.Birthday;
        details = this.Details;
    }
}
```

### Enclosed type
[Enclosed type]: #enclosed-type

Given:

> `History.cs`

```cs
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace ClassLibrary1
{
    public partial class History
    {
        private IEnumerable<Entry> entries;

        [Record]
        private partial class Entry
        {
            public int Id { get; }

            public string Name { get; }

            public string Details { get; }
        }
    }
}
```

Enclosing type must be declared partial, if it isn't RecordGen1000 error is raised (the generated partial won't compile).

## Diagnostics
[Diagnostics]: #diagnostics

The `Amadevus.RecordGenerator.Analyzers` package (pulled in by main package) provides
 diagnostics/codefixes that help you use Records correctly. See [Analyzers].

* [RecordGen1000](analyzers/rules/RecordGen1000.md) RecordMustBePartial with a codefix.

## Requirements
[Requirements]: #requirements

![Visual Studio logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Visual_Studio_2017_logo_and_wordmark.svg)

It is a `netstandard1.5` package, and the generation also works with CLI builds, both using `dotnet` and directly `msbuild`.

As this contains a Roslyn Analyzer with CodeFix, it requires **Visual Studio 2015+** (~~it should also work
with **VS Code**~~ nope, until [OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode#43](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/43)).

Additionally, because some of pulled dependencies are from CoreFx preview feed, you need to have `https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-corefxlab/api/v3/index.json` NuGet feed added. In the basic case where you don't already have any nuget.config in a directory where your `*.sln` file is, create one with following content (or copy from this repo):
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="api.nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
    <add key="corefxlab" value="https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-corefxlab/api/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```
The important part is the 'corefxlab' feed added to configuration.

`Amadevus.RecordGenerator` wouldn't work if not for @AArnott [AArnott's CodeGeneration.Roslyn](https://github.com/AArnott/CodeGeneration.Roslyn).

Analyzers in `Amadevus.RecordGenerator.Analyzers` were inspired by [xUnit.net's analyzers](https://github.com/xunit/xunit.analyzers).

All contributions are welcome, as well as critique. If you have any issues, problems or suggestions -
please open an issue.

When commiting a change, two main versioning mechanisms are branch name and version in `appveyor.yml`. Branch name will be used as a suffix when publishing packages on MyGet feed. Version will be used for both MyGet and releasing to NuGet. You might also update version in `/src/Directory.Build.props` - that's used for non-CI builds.
