## Description
[Description]: #description

C# Record Generator makes creating record classes a breeze! Just adorn your data class with `[Record]` attribute
and keep your code clean and simple. The backing code is generated on build-time, including IntelliSense support
(just save the file, Visual Studio will make a build in background).
